# Hooks (The "Brain")

This directory contains all of the application's reusable business logic, as per the "Brain vs. Body" architecture.

Each file should be a custom React hook (e.g., `useUserManager.js`) that encapsulates the logic for a specific business entity or feature. These hooks are responsible for data fetching, state management, and API interactions.
